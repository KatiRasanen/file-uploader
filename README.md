This is a demo for connecting React frontend with node.js express server.

## How to run?

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```
npm install
````

Start frontend on port 3000
```
npm run start
```

Start backend in other console on port 8080
```
node src\server\server.js
```

Now frontend is communicating with the local backend.

### Known issues
* server responses can' be read on frontend
* download not working correctly
